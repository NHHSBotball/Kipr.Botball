This is the North Hollywood Robotics Club's code for the 2012 Greater LA Botball
Competition.

I will update the files in the "src_CBCJVM" folder weekly based upon the files
in the "/cbc/CBCJVM/src" folder of the CBCJVM repo in NHHSRoboticsClub, which
will also be updated weekly with a pull from upstream.
