This is the North Hollywood Robotics Club's code for the 2012 Greater LA Botball
Competition.


We need to:

    1 . Implement the get...Chain() methods in the TaskChain class
    2 . Make said implementations and variables dynamic rather than static, probably by makin the task chain organizational more object-oriented.
    3 . Define and write strategies for the KelpRobot.
    4 . Calibrate our robots' drive trains
    ...
    ...
    ...
    ...
    ??. Test our finished programs.
