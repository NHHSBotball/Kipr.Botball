This is the North Hollywood Robotics Club's code for the 2012 Greater LA Botball
Competition.


IMPORTANT!!!
Jake, before you proceed any further, commit all significant changes to your code
and run configure.sh
After you do so, you and I will work on the block branch, while Jae will work on the kelp branch.
master is for stable merges from the two branches.

We need to:

    1 . Implement the get...Chain() methods in the TaskChain class
    2 . Make said implementations and variables dynamic rather than static, probably by makin the task chain organizational more object-oriented.
    3 . Define and write strategies for the KelpRobot.
    4 . Calibrate our robots' drive trains
    ...
    ...
    ...
    ...
    ??. Test our finished programs.
